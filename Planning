This is intended to be a rather simple text-based Undertale-style game

- Maze is based off of dict converted to crude grid system
- Based off of a five class system
    - Player talks about the player's movement
    - Maze creates the maze
    - Position talks about and relates the two previous classes' positions
    - Guide gives players hints and tips based on distance
    - Battle sets up and executes the final boss battle

    - Four moves: left, right, forward, backward
    - Player inputs moves, position changes and is compared, loops like so
    - Position must be regulated and maintained

Gameplay is divided into 2 phases:

Phase 1:
- Player traverses maze in search of exit
- Exit is chosen based on a random square on the grid
- Player moves on step at a time, guided by Mazer

Phase 2:
- Player reaches exit
- Must fight boss
- Has sword, shield, and potion
- Interesting gameplay

After phase 2 is completed, the player either wins or loses and restarts
